        Water intake refers to the amount of water a person needs to drink daily to stay properly hydrated and maintain healthy bodily functions.<br />
        Adequate water consumption is essential for regulating body temperature, maintaining organ function, transporting nutrients, and eliminating waste.

        The daily recommended water intake can vary based on individual factors such as age, weight, activity level, and environmental conditions. A common guideline for calculating water intake is based on body weight: approximately <strong>35 milliliters per kilogram of body weight</strong>.<br />
        For example, if a person weighs 70 kg, their estimated daily water intake would be:
    </p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <code style="background-color: #555; padding: 5px; color: #fff; font-family: monospace;">
            70 kg × 35 ml/kg = 2,450 ml
        </code>
    </p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        To make it easier to understand, this amount is often converted into liters:
    </p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <code style="background-color: #555; padding: 5px; color: #fff; font-family: monospace;">
            2,450 ml ÷ 1,000 = 2.45 liters
        </code>
    </p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        This calculation provides a baseline recommendation that may need adjustments for people with higher physical activity levels or exposure to hot climates.
